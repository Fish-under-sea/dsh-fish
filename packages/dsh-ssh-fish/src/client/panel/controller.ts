 * SSH panel controller: the single owner of the panel's view state.
 *
 * Framework-free (structural runtime faces, task-board core/controller.ts
 * style) so the sidebar row and the React panel share one tiny subscription
 * surface. The state lives only for the browser session (no persistence).
 *
 * The active tab, the hosts-tab connect request, the terminal tabs and their
 * host session ids live here rather than inside the panel components: the
 * layout mounts a keyed page only while its panel is selected, so
 * component-local state would reset the tab on every panel switch and lose
 * the ids a reattach needs.
 *
 * Terminal tabs (issue #1950) are records, not sockets. One tab is the tab
 * shown in the single xterm; a tab that is not shown either owns a detached
 * host session (reattached by id, which replays the host scrollback) or no
 * session at all. The controller is also the place where a still-connecting
 * socket is adopted when a view goes away: a connection that has not reported
 * its session id yet cannot be detached, so dropping it would leave the host
 * PTY with no owner (the orphan the reference implementation produced).
