/**
 * What one execution left behind: the text of its last assistant message,

 *
 * A settled execution used to carry only a verdict, so a parent card could see
 * that a subtask succeeded without ever seeing what it produced, and had to
 * guess or redo the work. The card's own content cannot answer that: card
 * content is the plan and freezes at the first execution
 * (`canEditTaskContent`), so the closing words of a run are recorded on the
 * execution record instead.
 *
 * Pure (no cordis, no runtime imports) so the settlement path is unit-testable
 * without a session, and so a text-less run degrades to "no field" rather than
 * to an empty string.
