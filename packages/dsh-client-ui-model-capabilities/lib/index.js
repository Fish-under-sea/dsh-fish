/**
* Host single-instance guard shared by the plugin family. The family bundle
* (dsh-web-all / dsh-skins) namespaces every child row id (web-ui-*), so
* the loader accepts a standalone install of the same package side by side;
* without this guard the second instance would still re-register the same
* webserver routes, tools, settings namespaces, and system-prompt sections
* and fail the boot. mountOnce makes a mount of an already-mounted package a
* no-op for as long as the first instance lives (the browser half is already
* deduped by package name in the client module host).
*
* A no-op is only safe while the holder is ALIVE. The holder can be disposed
* long after the refused mount ran its course: the Host reloads a profile by
* creating the new loader entries before the old ones are torn down (a
* plugin-manager enable/disable/install write, a settings-driven row reload,
* HMR), so the new aggregate shell entry mounts its family plugin while the
* previous entry still owns the name. Dropping that refused mount lost the
* plugin for good - the previous entry then disposed its own mount, releasing
* the name with nobody left to take it, and the family row stayed listed as
* active while its host routes 404ed (the task-board panel showed
* "board.hostError.notMounted", no degraded record appeared, and only a Host
* restart recovered it).
*
* The refused mount is therefore QUEUED, not dropped, and replayed the moment
* the holder releases the name - if the waiting fiber is still alive then. The
* single-instance guarantee is unchanged: exactly one mount is live per
* package name, and the replay re-enters the guard so a later mount still
* dedupes against it.
*
* The registry rides a global symbol so two module instances of the same
* package (npm copy vs repository link) still share one verdict. That symbol
* is a CROSS-REPOSITORY contract, not this file's private state: the four
* satellite packages (dsh-skins / dsh-pet / dsh-presets /
* dsh-community-plugins) are separate repositories carrying their own copy of
* this guard, rebuilt on their own schedule, so the value under `MOUNTED`
* must keep the shape every published copy reads (a `Set` of package names
* with `has`/`add`/`delete`). The wait queues this guard added therefore live
* under their own additive key, and the registry reads back a `Set` even when
* some other build left a different value there. Changing `MOUNTED`'s shape
* in place broke that contract once: a satellite's legacy copy created a
* `Set`, the family's new copy read it as a `Map`, and every family row
* mounted after it failed with "claims.get is not a function".
*
* cordis `ctx.effect` runs its callback immediately and treats the callback's
* return value as the fiber disposer, so the unmarker is returned, not run.
